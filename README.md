# Real-Time-Image-Processing-

This is a project on Real-Time Image Processing which involves Histogram Equalization, Segmentation techniques and 
Transformation techniques to affect the contrast/brighness of the real-time webcam image.
This is done on a Freescale DSP56858 kit using CodeWarrior in both C and Assembly.
